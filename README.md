Throughput legitimacy as a game changer in the Brexit vote:  A comparative analysis of the role of attitudes towards the EU’s throughput  legitimacy and immigration in the 2016 UK’s EU referendum.

Abstract
The surprising outcome of the United Kingdom’s EU referendum in 2016 left many unanswered 
questions as to why Brexit was successful. While previous research has focussed on attitudes towards
immigration and identity, as well as socioeconomic determiners, in explaining the vote for Leave, little 
attention has been paid to Britons’ Euroscepticism – voters’ perception of the EU’s legitimacy in 
particular. In this paper, I investigate the role of throughput legitimacy in the decision to vote for 
“Leave”. Using logistic regression on panel data from the British Election Study, I juxtapose
“throughput legitimacy” and “immigration” to determine the most important reason for voting for 
Leave. My results show that when deciding to vote “Leave”, most social controls point in the expected 
direction of the “losers of globalisation”-profile. “Throughput legitimacy” and “Immigration” as most 
decisive reasonsto vote in the EU referendum point strongly towards the vote choice “Leave”, however, 
it is not clear which reason was more important, as both issues showed similar effect range. 

Data
The data for the quantitative analysis is drawn from the British Election Study (BES). Since 2014 they 
explore voting behaviour through panel studies, adding to its historical panel evidence, which has been 
gathered since 1964 (British Election Study). This data is staggered into waves, based on time frames,
to examine “[…] within-person change and the evolution of political preferences and electoral 
behaviours” (British Election Study). The considerable batch of questions provides reliable and 
representative results through a large number of respondents. However, the survey is limited to the 
countries of Great Britain, leaving out Northern Ireland, which voted to remain in the EU (BBC). This 
makes my analysis only representative of Great Britain. 
To test the hypothesis, I make use of the variables from Hobolt’s modified seventh wave of the BES 
panel study, which leaves me with 31,409 participants. However, I only consider those, who have also 
taken part in Wave 8, therefore reducing the number of respondents to 22,885. I choose to do so because 
Wave 8 was conducted between the 6th of May and the 22nd of June 2016, ergo just before the vote
(British Election Study 2016) and therefore reflecting the most current vote intention. Given that these 
specific items were part of EU referendum data, which was collected in both Wave 7 and Wave 8, I 
assume that the answers remain stable. The data for the seventh wave was also collected in 2016, 
between the 14th of April and the 4th of May (Hobolt 2016: 1274), therefore leaving only a short break 
between each wave
